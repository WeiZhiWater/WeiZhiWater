I am a postdoc in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/), University Park. My research interests focus on **Critical Zone Science** and **Watershed Hydro-biogeochemistry**. More specifically, I am interested in understanding how water moves and interacts with other components in natural environments. Ultimately, I aim to understand and forecast water quantity and quality at the watershed- and continental-scale, using both the **process-based reactive transport model** and **the data-driven machine (deep) learning model**.
